## Simulation for the Number of Religios People
  We are simulating the estimated number of religious people in Hungary based on settlement population data. The study uses statistical modeling, including Poisson regression, to analyze how settlement type affects the proportion of religious individuals.

## data
  The dataset consists of 3,155 Hungarian settlements, with population sizes generated using a normal distribution. To ensure realistic values, negative populations were converted to positive. Settlements were then categorized into four types based on population size (small, medium-small, medium-large, large settlements). A synthetic individual-level population was generated based on the settlement sizes, and a random sample of individuals was assigned religious status using a probability of 1/3000.

  ## Researsch Description
  The goal of this study is to estimate the number of religious individuals in different types of settlements and analyze the factors influencing their distribution. We aggregated religious population counts at the settlement level.
